## Introduction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision and image processing. This white paper provides a comprehensive overview of CNN architecture, its components, and practical implementations.

## Fundamentals of CNNs

### What are CNNs?
Convolutional Neural Networks are a specialized type of neural network designed for processing structured grid data such as images. They are particularly effective in tasks involving:
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Image segmentation
- Feature extraction

### Key Advantages
1. Parameter sharing
2. Local connectivity
3. Hierarchical feature learning
4. Translation invariance

## CNN Architecture Components

### 1. Convolutional Layers
The fundamental building block of CNNs that performs feature extraction through convolution operations.

```python
# Example of a Convolutional Layer in PyTorch
import torch.nn as nn

conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(
    in_channels=3,    # RGB input
    out_channels=64,  # Number of filters
    kernel_size=3,    # 3x3 filter
    stride=1,
    padding=1
)
```

### 2. Pooling Layers
Used for dimensionality reduction and feature selection.

```python
# Example of a Max Pooling Layer
pooling_layer = nn.MaxPool2d(
    kernel_size=2,
    stride=2
)
```

### 3. Activation Functions
Commonly used activation functions in CNNs:
- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Leaky ReLU
- ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)

```python
# ReLU Activation
activation = nn.ReLU()
```

### 4. Fully Connected Layers
Used for final classification or regression tasks.

```python
# Example of a Fully Connected Layer
fc_layer = nn.Linear(
    in_features=1024,
    out_features=10  # Number of classes
)
```

## Popular CNN Architectures

### 1. LeNet-5
The pioneering CNN architecture developed by Yann LeCun.

```python
class LeNet5(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(LeNet5, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 6, 5)
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 4 * 4, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool1(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool2(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 4 * 4)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```

### 2. AlexNet
The architecture that won the ImageNet challenge in 2012.

### 3. VGGNet
Known for its simplicity and effectiveness.

### 4. ResNet
Introduced residual connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem.

## Implementation Examples

        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(64, 128, 3)
        
        # Pooling layer
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        
        # Fully connected layers
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(128 * 4 * 4, 512)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, 10)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Convolutional layers with ReLU and pooling
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv3(x)))
        
        # Flatten the output
        x = x.view(-1, 128 * 4 * 4)
        
        # Fully connected layers
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
